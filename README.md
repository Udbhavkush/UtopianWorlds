Utopian Worlds

My definition of Utopia
Utopia is a state of complete ideality.
Definition of ideality or utopia can be different for every individual.
I feel a world can be called an Utopian world based on following factors:
1. A basic elementary education for everyone.
2. Equal pay for all genders and ethnic groups.
3. Equal job opportunities for all genders and ethnic groups.
4. An ideal gender ratio of 1, which means that population of females is equal to the population of males.
5. Healthy citizens, that means high average lifespan of individual.

This is exploratory data analysis of two interesting fictional worlds to compare them and check if any of them or none of them is close to Utopia or not.
